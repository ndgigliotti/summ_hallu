       " 'We are writing regarding our Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select XXXX XXXX XXXX and what we believe was fraudulent and deceptive behavior by Citibank. \\n\\nWe had a Credit Limit of {$9000.00} On XX/XX/XXXX we made an electronic payment of {$5000.00}. Due to financial complications resulting from the XXXXOVID-19 pandemic the payment of {$5000.00} was returned. \\n\\nAt no point were we informed by Citibank that the aforementioned credit card was closed. \\n\\nWe dug ourselves out of our financial issues and called Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX in response to an email we received about making a payment. At this point our balance was {$15000.00} The issues begin with the XX/XX/XXXX call : On XX/XX/XXXX we spoke with a Citibank Representative and arranged to make a payment of {$6300.00} to be processed on 3/29/2021on the condition that once it cleared the account would be : 1. In good standing 2. Open 3. The card would be active ( meaning wed be able to use it ) We verified the above 3 conditions multiple times with the Citibank representative and they confirmed. \\nAs a side note, I remember specifically giving the Citibank Representative I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX an example of what my definition of open and usable was so there was no confusion. \\nWe also agreed to setup automatic minimum payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX we received a message from Citibank confirming that we had enrolled in autopay - no where in this message does it state that the account is closed. In fact it reads as if the account is opened and in good standing. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX the payment in the amount of {$6300.00} processed, cleared our account and posted to Citibank. \\n\\nAnd in fact based on what the Citibank representative confirmed on our XX/XX/XXXX call we made an additional payment on XX/XX/XXXX of {$4000.00}. We received an email from Citibank confirming this and again at no point did it state the account was closed, and again it reads as if the account is open. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX after we confirmed both payments ( {$6300.00} + {$4000.00} ) cleared with no issues, we checked our account to make sure the card was active - as the Citibank representative told us it would be. At this point we became worried and began calling Citibank. \\n\\nWe spent at least 4-5 hours and multiple phone calls on with different Citibank representatives, none of which could give us any direct answers. Finally, after poking around on the internet and in message boards we found a number for the Citibank XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nWe spoke with a very polite and helpful Citibank Representative in the XXXX XXXX XXXX who opened a case for us. \\n\\nAt this point I sent multiple emails following up and outlining what had transpired on the XX/XX/XXXX call. \\n\\nWe never once received an email response confirming receipt of emails. Everytime I would have to call and confirm receipt. \\n\\nAt some point we were assigned a woman by the name of XXXX XXXX with the Citibank XXXX XXXX unit. \\n\\nAfter multiple emails and phone calls, XXXX called us back on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nOn the XX/XX/XXXX call XXXX politely told me she listened to all our phone calls with Citibank especially the call in question that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX acknowledged/confirmed : That the Citibank Representative I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX, stated multiple times when asked by me ( multiple times ) if by making the payment of {$6300.00} it would bring our account ; in good standing/current, open, and usable - the representative answered \" Yes \\'\\'. She also acknowledged that in addition to answering \" Yes \\'\\' the representative communicated to me in other ways that by making said payment the account would be in good standing, open, and usable. \\n\\nWe expressed to XXXX that Citibank should honor what they committed to : An open account, in good standing, and with a useable card. \\n\\nWhile polite and understanding XXXX said there was nothing she could do. After we pressed her and explained we felt Citibanks behavior was deceptive ( We did not use the word fraudulent, although we believe it was ) XXXX offered us a {$150.00} statement credit, to which we declined. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX following the call with XXXX we sent a follow up email, confirming what transpired on our call. We called the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm the email was received and forwarded to XXXX - this was confirmed. \\n\\nWe would greatly appreciate the CFPBs assistance with this matter. \\n\\nThank you very much in advance!',\n",
       " 'I, XXXX, XXXX in natural person, creditor, and consumer status MAKE OATH AND SAY THAT : I am providing this statement pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1692a ( 3 ) consumer means any natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt. Also pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2 Block of information resulting from identity theft sent to, EQUIFAX XX/XX/XXXX REASONS : 1. Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) The Congress found that inaccurate credit reports directly impairs the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system ; 2. The Congress has stated that you, EQUIFAX are a scam pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 2 ) which states : An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating consumer credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers ; 3. The Congress has also stated that you EQUIFAX are assuming a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 3 ). Therefor youre only making pretend youre important or have a vital role without any proof ; 4. Furthermore, The Congress has stated Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( 4 ) that there is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibility with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. By you reporting inaccurate information without my written consent first, you are violating my right to privacy which is in direct violation of this law and The Privacy Act of 1974 ; 5. Notice that Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( b ) The Congress requires that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information. You, EQUIFAX are not meeting my needs as a consumer or being fair and equitable by reporting inaccuracies on my consumer file ; 6. Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( d ) the term consumer report means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumers credit worthiness ; 7. Take further notice that Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) you EQUIFAX are violation of this law as it clearly states that any report containing information solely as to transactions or experiences between the consumer and the person making the report which in this case is you EQUIFAX is excluded from the consumers report ; 8. Notice that you EQUIFAX are also in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( 2 ) ( B ) which states any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit indirectly by the issuer of a credit card. You are reporting multiple accounts on my consumer report in direct violation of this Code ; 9. You also cant claim you verified any accounts unless you can prove you did what you are supposed to do Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( e ) which defines an investigative consumer report as a consumer report in which information on a consumers character, general reputation, personal characteristics, is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, etc, who may have information of any items on the consumer file which you will have to show me proof via affidavit of fact under penalty of perjury ; 10. Take further notice that Pursuant to this same mentioned code stated above 15 U.S. Code 1681a ( e ) there shall not be any specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor as the term creditor means the same as it does in 15 U.S. Code 1691a ( e ) which states that the term creditor means any person who regularly extends credit which in this case that would be me a consumer ; 11. As a consumer I demand you remove the accounts listed below Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) which comprehensibly states that the only permissible purposes of consumer reports by any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report only under the following circumstances and no other and is in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates ; Pursuant to all the facts I stated above, here are my written instructions as to what I, a consumer in fact want removed from my report immediately.

Then last week, a ma n left a message twice on my recorder that he is attempting to collect a debt on behalf of Apelles LLC, but  the phone number he left to call back was  XXXX , not as shown on my call logs. I have no idea wh o this Apelles LLC is . I have never received any letter from a creditor informing me that this company has been retained to collect a debt on their behalf. I have filed a complaint with the BBB in  XXXX , OH where this company is headquartered and asked that they cease and desist in calling me and leaving messages on my recorder ( done last week ). I have not received anything back from BBB with a response from this Apelles. I do not have a private voice messaging center as caretakers have access to my recorder as I am in and out of the hospital much due to   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . The FDCPA prohibits debt collects from leaving voicemail messages when the voicemail is not completely private with others having access to voicemail messages. My caretakers took these  XXXX  voicemail messages left by this ma n ( no name left ) and are  now aware that I am having financial difficulties. Another call came in again this mornin g (   XXXX / XXXX / 17   ) which tells me that this company has not responded to the BBB ( if it is even this company making these calls ). I  am a very ill person with   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX  and can not tolerate such calls coming into my home numerous times a day. Again, I have not received any letter from creditors info rming me that Apelles has been retained to collect a debt. Any outstanding debt that I have has been addressed directly with my creditors and none of them have retained Apelles to collect my debt. It is enough that I have to deal with the massive amount of robo calls that are coming in every day from all over the country, let alone someone I do n't even know leaving messages on my voicemail about co llecting a debt. I have saved the messages that were left on my voicemail by this man ( again, unidentified ), and if this continues I will file for the {$1000.00} fine for each call that continues to come into my home.\",\n",
       " \"Please see CFPB complaint XXXX and note I recently submitted to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office complaint XXXX regarding XXXX. Note there are issues with my cosigner. There is a malicious takeover of commercial interests and extends back to personal matters. Some of her family has been involved and I believe has used her co signing on this loan and other things in various matters they have sought to deny and deprive me information of. Not only is information being denied, but my accounts are being monitored and cut off and the communications I do receive are hijacked. I intend to ensure the copyright I made is put in my name. This individual is not communicating with me and I believe from others I am being victimized. There are other complaints. There properties were put into foreclosure. I was not informed and I do have overlapping property. I want to know how these loans were taken into account. Some of those involved in takeover do stem from the program I attended at XXXX I believe but since then the program has dissolved diminishing it's value and I was not notified. Here is text to the complaint. Please also note the check I received from Discover number XXXX is not valid and I need a new one. However I requested information about this due to suspicions about this program and it's connection to other matters. hence I would like this addressed also. I am seeking discharge and repayment to the listed parties. Here is my complaint made referencing XXXX because they were the original loan holder and believe this transfer could be due to my situation. Please explain and provide me the original documents from XXXX also. Again here is complaint XXXX made to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : The XXXX XXXX XXXX program I obtained these loans to attend dissolved diminishing the value of the program. I believe it is apart of the privacy and human rights violations I have experienced apart of a long range takeover of commercial interests. For example, some could extent to copyright XXXX which is a film/tv project regarding the anti nuclear movement from the 70s and 80s. However, I would like to also emphasize I believe there is IP ( that I have not formalized and the oppression I am experiencing designed to prevent ) regarding ediscovery. ISO began developing a set of ediscovery standards that actually began after these matters and is currently in the process of updating and implementing more for example standards XXXX and XXXX and due to being violated in a medical procedure some of this now may interact with what I believe is a cortical modem of some kind interacting with my account and ediscovery process. However, this XXXX XXXX program is something I believe was targeted as apart of their long term de meriting process. and the student loans themselves something those have targeted in their attempts to degrade me. XXXX XXXX, the individual whose name I put the copyright in was a co signer. Her family has been exceedingly malicious and I believe targeting my life even before. Hence I believe these loans were a factor even prior to their transfer to Discover. I am requesting all details of these loans and any information regarding them. In terms of participating in the financing of my projects and unfortunately complicity in takeover attempt. XXXX could be an involved party, and these loans used for those purposes also. I need to know if they are involved in this in anyway also. Please see attached CFPB complaint regarding Discover for details on issues related to that.\",\n",

The new credit reports ( XX/XX/XXXX) all omitted this valuable information ( listed as \" NA \\'\\' or nothing at all with not payment amounts ) and it lowers the evaluation score pulled by lenders.\\n\\n- My XXXX XXXX Loans length is not displayed and shows that my loans activity has started in XX/XX/XXXXbut the loans age should not be changed because the lender is the same and only the servicer has changed.\\n\\n- My U.S. Education Loans were once only reported as one loan even though there were actually two. This has since been changed but didn\\'t increase my credit history average.\\n\\n- I have attached XXXX  credit card statements for your review. You will notice that there are occasions when my credit card utilization is high. If you reference my XX/XX/XXXX and XXXXt bank statements you will notice that there was a credit card utilization of {$900.00} ( approximately 9 % utilization ). No factors in my credit, debit or purchases have changed since XX/XX/XXXX but this past XXXX I utilized approximately 9 % and my score went down 10 points instead of three. The recommended utilization for a credit card is 20 % and I barely use half of that so my credit card score shouldn\\'t have even gone down three points this past XXXX  and certainly not 10. There is no reason for this change and I believe that they are using unfair practices to evaluate my score by miss reporting information.\\n\\n- My on-time payments, my consistently low credit card utilization and my decrease in hard inquiries on my account should have significantly increased my credit score but information has been changed and inaccurately reported resulting in my credit score only going up 7 points ( XXXX  : XXXX  > XXXX ), 0 points ( XXXX XXXX > XXXX  ), and -1 point ( Equifax XXXX>XXXX  ). I have attached the full credit reports from XX/XX/XXXXfor all three bureaus. You can review the soft XXXX  from XX/XX/XXXX to review the credit scores that I had at that time.\\n\\ndamage ever since.\\n\\n- The first time I called to address the why my score went down I was told that my score didn\\'t change, the second time I called I was told that the score is low because of two late payments back in XX/XX/XXXX. But I have been recovering from that damage for four years now and its impact on my score shouldn\\'t have changed because all the factors in my reports have stayed the same.

This is why I have tried correcting the addresses on file. \\n\\nXXXX proceeded to send me an amended credit report to AN OLD ADDRESS. The only way I KNOW of this is that my brother still happens to live there. I have not lived in that house in over ten years. \\n\\nI have the same problem with XXXX. They have incorrect addresses on file, some that are just outright nonexistent, and when I tried correcting the issue, the only thing they were able to do was remove the nonexistent ones. They corrected the ones that were wrong, but they did not change my current address. I tried to buy a XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX site, and they verify credit through XXXX. I only know this because it did not work with my current information, but when I utilized the WRONG information listed on XXXX, it verified my identity on XXXX XXXX site. I have tried to explain that the addresses they have listed are in the wrong order, and are completely incorrect in terms of my timeline for living in them. They still think I'm living in Florida, in my very first apartment there, from ten years ago. It should also be said that due to their incorrect address information, I am unable to pull my credit report from them online due to incorrect questions being asked. There is no conceivable way I know the answer to half of them, hence I must've gotten one wrong at some point because it has now locked me out of accessing my credit report any other way than to mail things in. It is incredibly infuriating. \\n\\nWith Equifax, my credit report with them is literally the shortest-lived report of all three. They have barely any information to give me, and when companies try to pull my credit, Equifax refuses to come up. I have checked multiple times to see if there is a freeze or a fraud alert on my account, and as far as I can tell there are neither. I even went so far as to FAX IN MY INFORMATION to those XXXX because they demanded it to verify my identity by phone and give me any further information, and those pieces of XXXX claim they never got my fax. I had to spend a dollar per page, three pages, just to fax something to them, and they LOST MY XXXX INFORMATION. It seems to be a trend with Equifax, I guess. My husband and I are trying to buy a home, and so our credit is having to be checked. Fortunately they can pull two of three up for me, but even so, the fact that Equifax just adamantly refuses to pull for me is concerning. I can not make heads or tails of it and NO ONE there is willing to help me at all. It is the most aggravating feeling, feeling like someone is holding my entire existence hostage.\"]"
